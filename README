All Blue:

Initial Idea:
- Convert given image into an image into black and white, leaving only places that are blue as colored pixels.


Improvements:
- not all shades of blue are recognized, must find the appropriate threshold
- can be made more general by adding color as input, convert an image/set of images with given color (green/blue/red)
